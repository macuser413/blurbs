                <p>blurbs is a tool to create small sound snippets to share with others. These core concept around blurbs was to create a tool to allow listeners, performers, and creators from all over the world to record a snippet to provide Better Radio with content. This content can include anything from a call sign from a listener or musician, a vague weather report, a song introduction, a poem, an encouragement, and so on. These can then be downloaded and submitted to the station to be inserted into the broadcast library and shared with the world.</p>
